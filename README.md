This repository contains an example of a common error in Ada programming: insufficiently specific exception handling when working with arrays. The original code (`bug.ada`) shows an example where a general `others` exception handler masks the possibility of more specific errors related to array access.  The solution (`bugSolution.ada`) demonstrates how to refine exception handling for better error identification and reporting.
